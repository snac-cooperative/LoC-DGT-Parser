# LoC DGT Parser

This repository contains a parser for the Library of Congress' Demographic Group Terms.  It transforms MARC XML into a JSON object that is easier to use in PHP.  It does require a pre-processing step to convert the MARC into XML and to replace the related and broader terms with their ID.
